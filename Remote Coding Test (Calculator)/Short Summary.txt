Remote Coding Test (Calculator)(1 man day)

Summary:
The calculator application is able to provide the correct answer for all the questions stated. 
A screenshot will be attach along to display all the correct answers.
The solution for the calculator application is using Stack class to store all the numbers and operators then perform the calculation.
The application is able to return errors when invalid input or blank and also able to execute when correct input.

Steps:
1. Create validations to ensure the correct input. Only allow .0123456789+-*/()
2. Create 1 string and 2 Stack classes.
3. Looping all the characters from the questions. (10.1-(2+3*(7-5))
3. When numbers, store into the string. When operators or open bracket, store into a operator Stack. When close bracket, take the numbers and operators then assign into the string.
4. Example: (10-(2+3*(7-5)), the string will be 10.1;2;3;7;5;-*+-
5. Create another looping for the string 10.1;2;3;7;5;-*+-.
6. When hit semicolon(;), store the numbers before semicolon to a number Stack which created earlier.
	When hit operator, retrieve out and remove the top number from the number stack as num2 and retrieve and remove the top number from the number stack as num1.
	Then do the calculation and store back the result into the number stack.
7. Example: 10.1;2;3;7;5;-*+- When hit minus operator, take 5 as num2 and take 7 as num1, 7-5=2
8. After store the result, the number stack has the remaining 4 numbers: 10.1,2,3,2
9. Subsequently, when hit *, will be 3*2=6 and store back. number Stack: 10.1,2,6
10. Next operator, when hit +, will be 2+6=8 and store back. number Stack: 10.1,8
11. Lastly, when hit -, will be 10.1-8=2.1 The final result will display on the console screen.
